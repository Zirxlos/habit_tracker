# My habit tracking app

This habit tracking app is a project made while learning how to use OOP with python during my training at IU 
International Hochschule.

## What is it?

This app is used to help a user track good habits they want to implement.
They can create new habits inside the app and chose whether they want to complete them daily or weekly.
You have on the menu the choice between:
- getting feedback on your habits (getting the habit with the longest streak and 
the one with the shortest streak)
- or calling a list of all your habits and there you can select one and decide if
you want to check it for today, delete it, get your current streak or get the longest streak ever
